# Library

This is a [Minecraft Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod that houses the shared code across my other mods. It does nothing on its own. 

## Usage

1. Download the mod file (`.jar`) from [the latest release](https://github.com/viral32111/library/releases/latest).
2. Place the mod file in the server's `mods` directory.
3. Start the server.
